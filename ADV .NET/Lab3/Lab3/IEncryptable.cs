    Interface: IEncryptable.cs
    Author:    Nicholas J. Corkigian
    Date:      February 18, 2010

    Purpose: This interface has two methods that classes making use of must
            implement. 

            The class implementing the Encrypt() method will use some sort
            of encryption algorithm to return some encrypted data.
 
            The class implementing the Decrypt() method will use (presumably)
            the same encryption algorithm to return a decrypted string.

            This code is not to be altered.
