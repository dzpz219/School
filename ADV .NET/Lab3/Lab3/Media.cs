    Purpose: This abstract class represents a single object of a media type,
            be it something like a book, movie, or song.

            Other classes must be derived from this class.
 
            Because it implements the ISearchable interface, all derived
            classes will also need to implement the methods of that
            interface as well.

            This code is not to be altered.

            search key, the Search() method will either locate that string in
            the Title property or it will not.

            If not overridden, this method can be used by all derived classes 'as is'.
