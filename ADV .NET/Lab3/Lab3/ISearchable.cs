    Purpose: This interface has one method that classes making use of must
            implement. 

            The class implementing the Search() method will be assumed to
            use a string search key as a parameter and return a boolean
            value to indicate if that key was successfully found.

            This code is not to be altered.
*/

    interface ISearchable
    {
        bool Search(string key);
    }
}
